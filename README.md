### Class
What is a class? A class is like a cookie cutter or blue print for objects but not the object itself.

What can you do with a cookie?
    - eat it!


### Methods
Functions which specifically belong to a class/object

###Instance
A version or example of an object which has defined variables and attributes.


### Syntax

```python

class Dog():

    def __init__(self,attr1,attr2, optional_attri='default'):
        self.attribute1 = attr1,
        self.attribute2 = attr2,
        self.optional_attribute = optional_attri
    

    def method_name(self,arg1):
        #complex block
        arg1 += arg1 +1
        return arg1


```


## OOP 4 Pillars

### Abstraction

### Encapsulation

### Inheritance
The ability of a subclass to inherit all the behaviour and method from parent class.
One of the core reasons to use OOP, because it means you write less code. In reality this is debatable, as you end-up having ot adapt a lot of methods.
It also depends how good of a coder you are and your ability to abstract effectively

### Polymorphism 


##### API
A standard way of passing information
